    <p><b>N'golo</b> (anglicized <b>Engolo</b>) is a traditional African martial art that combines elements of combat and dance, performed in a circle accompanied by music and singing.</p>

    <p>Engolo is essentially a primitive form of capoeira in which many movements representing trademark of <i>capoeira</i> were developed, such as <i>Meia-lua de frente</i>, <i>Meia lua de compasso</i> / <i>Rabo de arraia</i>, <i>Escorpião</i>, <i>Chapa</i>, <i>Chapa de costas</i>, <i>Aú batido</i>, <i>Rasteira</i>, <i>Queda de rins</i> and many others.</p>
    
    <p>Engolo has been played in Africa for centuries, primarily among the Bantu peoples in southern Angola. It gained public attention only after capoeira became globally famous in the second half of the 20th century.</p>
