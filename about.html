    <h1>About</h1>
    
    <p>I am Damjan, a capoeira disciple from Belgrade. I made this website for myself, to help me learn the capoeira moves and their names.</p>

    <p>The goal of this website is not to be a complete list of all capoeira movements (such a thing is not even possible, because capoeira is alive), but to include all the most important techniques, and to organize them meaningfully and hierarchically.</p>

    <p>I am also interested in <i>n'golo</i> (anglicized <i>engolo</i>), a primitive form of capoeira from Angola.</p>
