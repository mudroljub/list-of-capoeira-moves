    <p><b>N'golo</b> (anglicized <b>Engolo</b>) is a traditional African martial art that combines elements of combat and dance, performed in a circle accompanied by music and singing.</p>

    <p>Engolo is essentially a primitive form of capoeira in which many movements representing trademark of <i>capoeira</i> were developed, such as <i>Meia-lua de frente</i>, <i>Meia lua de compasso</i> / <i>Rabo de arraia</i>, <i>Escorpião</i>, <i>Chapa</i>, <i>Chapa de costas</i>, <i>Aú batido</i>, <i>Rasteira</i>, <i>Queda de rins</i> and many others.</p>
    
    <p>Engolo has been played in Africa for centuries, primarily among the Bantu peoples in southern Angola. It gained public attention only after capoeira became globally famous in the second half of the 20th century.</p>

    <h2>History</h2>  
      
    <p>In the 16th century, Portuguese colonists began capturing slaves from Angola and transporting them to Brazil. The Portuguese soon noticed that the captured African warriors had a strange skill that helped them resist. Groups of freed slaves began establishing their settlements in remote areas, which they called <i>kilombo</i>, meaning a war camp in the Bantu language. Portuguese sources mentioned that it took more than one dragoon to capture a quilombo warrior, as they defended themselves with a <i>strangely moving fighting technique</i>. Some quilombos grew to become independent states, with the largest one, Quilombo dos Palmares, lasting nearly a century (1605-1694).</p>
    
    <p>Around the 17th century, the Angolan martial art in Brasil started being referred to as <b>Capoeira</b>, named after the clearings in the forest where free Angolans lived. It was also said that slaves were playing <b>Angola</b>, which actually came from the same Bantu word as Engolo (<i>ngolo</i> - energy, strength).</p>

    <p>In the 18th century, capoeira spread to cities, including Rio de Janeiro, Salvador, and Recife. The colonial government attempted to suppress capoeira, imposing severe punishments, including hunting down and openly killing practitioners. Extensive police records from the time show that many slaves and freed slaves were detained for practicing capoeira:</p>

    <blockquote>From 288 slaves that entered the Calabouço jail during the years 1857 and 1858, 80 (31%) were arrested for capoeira, and only 28 (10.7%) for running away.</blockquote>
    
    <p>In the 19th century, urban capoeira became associated with crime, gangs, and political assassinations, earning a notorious reputation. The street version of capoeira that developed in the capital of Brazil was called capoeira carioca (carioca means a Rio de Janeiro resident).</p>
    
    <p>At the beginning of the 20th century, Anibal Burlamaqui (<b>Mestre Zuma</b>) and Agenor Moreira Sampaio (<b>Mestre Sinhozinho</b>) first codified the street version of capoeira as a national martial art, removing musical and dance elements and incorporating strikes from boxing, judo, and other disciplines. Soon after, in the 1930s, <b>Mestre Bimba</b> founded the regional style of capoeira, which included elements of music and dance. Finally, in the 1940s, in response to the popularization of corrupted forms of capoeira, <b>Mestre Pastinha</b> founded the Capoeira Angola school, returning to its African roots.</p>
