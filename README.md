## Descriptions

Here is the description of capoeira as seen by the painter Rugendas (when he was in Brazil for the first time between 1822 and 1825):

"The black people have yet another much more violent warrior pastime, capoeira: two champions rush at each other trying to hit their opponent's chest with their heads, attempting to knock them down. They avoid the attack with agile leaps to the side and equally skillful stops; but by throwing themselves at each other more or less like goats, they often end up crashing head-on, which sometimes turns the play into a brawl and knives come into play, staining it with blood."

 This is what happened: two guys about 19 years old passed in the street and did corta-capim. There were two men in the doorway of a store. Chico said to Pedro: “Pedro, that there is the dance of the Nagô negro. Do that movement to a person and the person will fall.” I was ten years old at the time.
